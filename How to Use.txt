Created a basic VBA that sorts the results of games played in Clash Royale. This lets me see what cards and the levels were used against me.

I'll create a public one for others to use. Right now, this is uploaded based on my own stats so people can see what I'm trying to achieve in creating this program.

HOW TO USE

-- Select Start Over to begin
-- Choose Ranked, Blitz Tourney or Challenge
-- If choosing Wins or Losses, you can choose Calculate Splits or Calculate All
-- If you don't choose Wins or Losses, you must choose Calculate All
-- To clear, select Start Over
